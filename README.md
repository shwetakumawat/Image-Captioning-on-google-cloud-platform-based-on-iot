## Design Details

We provide a decentralized solution that is migrated completely on the cloud for the purpose of this problem. Fig 1 diagrammatically displays the architecture that we have used in order to build our application. The model can be broadly divided into four major components namely, non- compute IoT devices, rekognition compute nodes, polly compute nodes and a single DApp node. Devices interact with one another in order to ask for services and provide results over a MQTT publish subscribe model. Each of these components and the communication between them has been described in greater detail below:



**Non-Compute IoT Devices**: The devices shown on the left-hand side (in a vertical queue) are the non-compute IoT devices. As per our problem statement these devices should have picture capturing and audio playing capabilities. As the name suggests this device does not have compute capabilities and relies on the network of compute nodes in order to get the final audio file for the image it publishes on the network. The non-compute IoT devices have been simulated on the Google Cloud Platform.

**Rekognition Compute Nodes**: This node has also been simulated using the Google Cloud Platform IoT Core service. The blue nodes that have been placed vertically on the left-hand side represent the rekognition compute nodes in Fig 1. As the name suggests this node has compute capabilities. The non-compute node sends the images to this node and this node is tasked with running the image through the object detection model and returns the labels identified to the caller IoT device. This node receives the image over the MQTT queue and then stores it on the cloud. We have used AWS S3 to meet our storage needs. AWS also offers the Image Rekognition service which has a ML model pre-trained for object detection and this node uses this service on the image stored in the S3 bucket so as to get the labels in the image. The decision of which node serves which request has been made by a three-way handshake between the non-compute node and this node, such that the first node that provides an acknowledgement to the non-compute device is tasked with serving the request. Details of this communication have been presented later in the part where the MQTT communication is discussed.

**Polly Compute Nodes**: This node has also been simulated using the Google Cloud Platform IoT Core service. As the name suggests this node has compute capabilities. The blue nodes that have been placed horizontally at the bottom represent the polly compute nodes in Fig 1. The non-compute node sends the labels that it has received from the Rekognition Compute node to this node and this node is tasked with running the labels through the text-to-speech-model and an audio file that reads out the labels is sent to the caller IoT device. This node receives the image over the MQTT queue and then stores it on the cloud. We have used AWS S3 to meet our storage needs. AWS also offers the Image Rekognition service which has a ML model pre-trained for object detection and this node uses this service on the image stored in the S3 bucket so as to get the labels in the image. These labels are again returned using the MQTT queue. The decision of which node serves which request has been made by a three-way handshake between the non-compute node and this node, such that the first node that provides an acknowledgement to the non-compute device is tasked with serving the request. Details of this communication have been presented later in the part where the MQTT communication is discussed.

**DApp Node**: Our architecture currently supports a single DApp Node. The single IoT device present in the rightmost coroner of Fig 1 is the DApp node in the design diagram. This node is used for authentication before giving the device access to the MQTT central queue. For our project, we have used the Ropsten test network where each device has a wallet with address and private keys. The device gets access to the central queue as soon as a payment of 0.02 ether has been made via the “pay()” function in the smart contract pushed to the Ropsten test network. This is reflected in the Metamask wallet and can be seen on Etherscan as well. The user interface of the same can be seen in the figure below.

**MQTT Publish/Subscribe**: The devices interact between themselves using the MQTT Pub/Sub model. GCP provides a MQTT bridge for registries and we made use of that. Every device in the network (except DApp) is subscribed to the central topic (‘projects/project2-277316/topics/my-topic’ in our case). The compute nodes read messages from this queue and act on them only if it is a request that can be handled by it. The communication from the compute node to the non-compute device is more secure however, since the compute nodes publish the message directly to the device’s config which is private to the device. The direction of communications between devices and nodes has been shown in Fig1 through arrows. As can be seen only the non-compute nodes publish information to the central topic, while the compute nodes only read from this topic. The interaction from the compute node to the non-compute device is done to the device’s config directly.
An additional benefit of using a central queue across all services is that this makes the architecture very portable and easy to modify in case a new service has to be added at a later development stage.

## Components

**Decentralized (P2P) component**: In order to ensure that our design has decentralized peers and compute capabilities we have tweaked the way we publish and acknowledge requests from the MQTT queue. Fig2 explains how the P2P status has been ensured.

**IoT component**: As explained above, all the devices and nodes have been simulated as IoT devices on GCP, hence covering this requirement.

**Machine Learning component**: Both Rekognition and Polly use ML models in order to detect objects and convert text to speech, hence covering this requirement

**Multiple Clouds**: While all our devices and nodes are in GCP, the ML support for the architecture has been taken from AWS Polly and Rekognition services, hence covering this breadth

**DApp component**: The DApp server which is a part of the IoT core in GCP, utilizes the Web3 python library to interact with the smart contract pushed on the Ropsten Network with the help of its address and ABI.
